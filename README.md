🗃️ Basic SQL Queries (DDL & DML)
This repository contains basic SQL queries created as part of my course. The SQL scripts are divided into two categories:

🏗️ DDL (Data Definition Language) – for creating database structure

📝 DML (Data Manipulation Language) – for inserting, updating, and retrieving data

🔄 Important:
Please execute the DDL file first to set up the necessary database schema before running any DML queries.

📁 Files Included
DDL.sql – Contains table creation scripts and primary key constraints

DML.sql – Includes INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements based on the created schema

🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my database course and demonstrates my understanding of basic SQL operations, including schema creation and data handling.
